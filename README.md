# Retention-curve
This project is a raw PHP (7.4+) demo project.
This is a sample project for fetching and manipulating data from a CSV file.
Developed an object-oriented code, especially considering design thinking to be generic, extendable, easy to maintain by
other staff members while thinking about performance.

Highcharts JS library was used to polulate chart using JSON data provided by the simple REST API.
